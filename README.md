📊 Student Purchase Behavior Analysis using Pandas
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer purchase dataset using Python and Pandas. The dataset includes fields like purchase price, language, job title, credit card details, and email domains.

🔍 Key tasks included:

Checking null values and data types

Analyzing purchase trends (AM vs PM)

Filtering by language, job role, and card type

Identifying top email providers

Investigating card expiry years and high-value purchases

This project helped me strengthen my data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation skills using Pandas, and extract actionable insights from real-world structured data.
